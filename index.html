    <h>Get To Know Ya Boy</h>
    <p>
        They say life is what you make it. So for the last twenty-six years, I've tried to make the most of it. 
        From exploring the world to making a choice to defend the freedoms that we hold dear, these experiences
        have equip me in viewing challenges with a clear mind and perspectives modified by struggles unbenounced to 
        most. This is a peel into the onion I call my life, so having you even get this far is a BIG F-ing Deal!
    </p>
    <p1>
        Here you will explore a portfolio of work that this crazy mind of mine threw together, so take a peek, smile, nod, and try not to applaud!
        This is a portfolio that displays the various skills I've honed in training and self teachings, while still managing to push unsolicited 
        advice and recommendations on to you like a sample table at your local Costco.
        Enjoy!
